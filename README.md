Maya Devkit Backups, because Autodesk can't seem to keep them in one place. 

They have moved the hosting location no less than 6 times over the last 3 or 4 years. I had to look for them for 30 minutes just now before finding them and collecting them.

Use this for historical purposes and only in case AD moves them yet again- if you want to download them directly from Autodesk, the spot in which they are hosted today is [here](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/maya). No guarantees that will be where they're at tomorrow.
